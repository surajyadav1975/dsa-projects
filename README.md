#### SHORTEST-PATH-VISUALIZER-USING-DIJKSTRA-BFS : https://dsa-projects-mu.vercel.app/
#### SORTING-VISUALISER : https://dsa-projects-iwk6.vercel.app/

This repository contains two projects focused on Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA): a Shortest Path Finding Visualizer and a Sorting Visualizer. These projects provide interactive visualizations to help understand the workings of BFS, Dijkstra's algorithm, and various sorting algorithms.

## Projects

### 1. Shortest Path Finding Visualizer

#### Overview
The Shortest Path Finding Visualizer demonstrates how BFS (Breadth-First Search) and Dijkstra's algorithm work to find the shortest path in a grid-based graph. Users can interact with the visualizer by setting a starting node, a finishing node, and visualizing the algorithms in action.

#### Features
- Interactive grid representing a graph of nodes.
- Set starting and finishing nodes.
- Buttons to trigger BFS and Dijkstra's algorithm visualizations.
- Animated visualization showing the pathfinding process.
  
#### Technologies Used
- HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React, Tailwind for the front-end.
- Gsap for animations.
- Algorithms: BFS and Dijkstra's.

#### Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/surajyadav1975fk/dsa-projects.git

2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```sh
   cd dsa-projects/Pathfinding-visualizer-ingraph
   
3. Run 'npm run dev' command.

#### Usage
- Open the visualizer in your web browser.
- Set the starting and finishing nodes by clicking on the grid.
- Click on the BFS or Dijkstra button to start the visualization.
- Watch as the algorithm finds the shortest path.


### 2. Sorting Visualizer

#### Overview
The Sorting Visualizer project demonstrates how different sorting algorithms work by visualizing the process on an array represented by bars of varying heights. Users can control the array size and the speed of the visualization.

#### Features
- Visualizes various sorting algorithms.
- Buttons to trigger different sorting algorithms.
- Bars of different heights represent the array.
- Sliders to change the size of the array and the speed of the algorithm.

#### Technologies Used
- HTML, CSS, JavaScript,React,Tailwind  for the front-end.
- Sorting Algorithms: Bubble Sort, Quick Sort, Merge Sort, Heap Sort.
  
#### Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/surajyadav1975fk/dsa-projects.git
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```sh
   cd dsa-projects/sorting-visualizer
3. Run 'npm start' in your web browser to start the visualizer.
   
#### Usage
- Open the visualizer in your web browser.
- Adjust the sliders to set the array size and the speed of the algorithm.
- Click on the buttons to trigger different sorting algorithms.
- Watch the bars being sorted in real-time.
